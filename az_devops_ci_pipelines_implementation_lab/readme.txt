multiple microservice architecture application
1 micro service in python/.net/nodejs n there are 2 databases

implement the continuous integration for this application

the business app is taken from https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app:
- it is a front-end web app in Python which lets you vote between two options

i'll automate the CI part on azure devops platform using azure pipelines:
i'll automate it from scratch in:
- writing the docker file
- building the continuous integration system for different microservices that have different programming languages

In doing this project:
- i understand better how the business app is built in running it locally
- only then i can write the ci, docker files, etc...
